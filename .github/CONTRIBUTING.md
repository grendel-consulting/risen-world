# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

We're conducting an experiment here:
[working in the open](https://visitmy.website/2020/01/25/blogging-working-open/)
and mashing up strategic, narrative and role-playing game styles. We're finding
out what works, and for that other perspectives matter.

## Our Code of Conduct

Our project and everyone participating in it are governed by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to
uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project team at
[hello@grendel-consulting.com](mailto:hello@grendel-consulting.com)

## Getting Started

Raise an issue to
[start a conversation](https://github.com/grendel-consulting/static-site-template/issues/new?template=conversation-starter.md)
about the opportunity or issue you've found; that provides us an opportunity
to understand what you've spotted, where it challenges our approach and where
it augments it.

## Our Conventions and Styleguides

We practise [trunk-based developmet](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) with
[short-lived feature branches](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/short-lived-feature-branches/)
for everything being worked on by humans. Bots handle the heavy lifting in the
subsequent pull requests.

We use Linters and Code Formatters to maintain a consistent opinionated style.

We use Code Scanners to help spot bugs, issues and vulnerabilities.

We pin dependencies and then keep them evergreen automagically.
